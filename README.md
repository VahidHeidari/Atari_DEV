Introduction:
=============

Atari_DEV is a open source Atari 2600 emulator for educational and experimental purposes.

I want to port this emulator on a STM32F103ZET6 micro controller, and making
a portable and hand held game console, which can run on a low cost ARM device.
There is may Atari 2600 emulators in the world, but none of them runs on low cost
micro controllers, most of them runs on PCs. I want to make a simple and easy to
build system, witch anyone can make and enjoy it.

Key map:
========
* Esc -> Quit emulator
* Arrow keys -> Directional buttons
* F1 to F4 keys -> Save game state into slot 1 to slot 4
* F5 to F8 keys -> Load game state from slot 1 to slot 4
